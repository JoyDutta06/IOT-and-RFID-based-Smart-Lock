# IOT and RFID based Smart Lock (2)

## Abstract:-

Here, we are going to build a simple RFID-based smart lock using an Arduino and Bolt IOT Module as the backbone and a few cheap components.
RFID (radio-frequency identification) identifies data stored on a chip in a card or dongle, and compares them to a list of tags that have already been scanned.
In this project, we will build a test circuit to control access using a MFRC522 reader module, to open and close a lock. Weâ€™ll use a master keycard to add or remove access to different tags, and we will connect an LCD display  to tell us what is happening in the system/circuit. Solenoid Lock is used and a MOSFET to safely trigger it on and off using our Arduino and Bolt  IOT module.
This type of smart lock can be used in lockers, Hotels, Residential Buildings, Office etc. where one can open the locker or door using the appropriate tags. If any type of damage occurs in the Arduino or the RFID module or if they lose their tags, the owner/in-charge can still unlock their locker/door via IOT which means they can unlock the door with any device having the internet connectivity. Hence, they can make necessary corrections in the arduino/rfid reader without breaking the locker/door.
